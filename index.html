                    <p>The goal is to implement a Node.js HTTP server that will have an endpoint intended for streaming
                        songs, i.e., audio data. A client could then start consuming the data by making a request to
                        that endpoint.</p>

                    <p>We also need to implement some kind of a control panel so we can manage what song will be
                        streamed next. On top of that, we will implement a simple webpage with a play button, similar to
                        how most the online radios look.</p>

                    <p>We will put all of this into a single application, which would not be so smart for a real-world
                        solution, but hey, we are just having fun. The entire code from this article can be found on my
                        GitHub repo here.</p>

                    <p>Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="heading">
                    <h1>Control panel</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Since I love meddling with the terminal, and Node.js has a built in CLI, we will implement the
                        control panel in the form of a terminal GUI. After a little bit of research, I discovered that
                        neo-blessed is a library made for this task.</p>

                    <p>neo-blessed has a concept of boxes. Those are basically windows that you can create, stylize, and
                        position in the terminal, like components in a browser using HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <p>Let&rsquo;s first define the main screen that will wrap everything else. We will put it inside
                        the View class:</p>


                    <pre>class View {
constructor() {
    const screen = NeoBlessed.screen({ smartSCR: true });
    screen.title = 'Node Radio Mini';
    screen.key(['escape', 'C-c'], () => process.exit(0));   
    this._screen = screen;
}
appendBoxes(boxes) {
    for (const box of boxes) {
        this._screen.append(box);
    }
}
render() {
    this._screen.render();
}
}</pre>


                    <p>Here we create a main screen of the view layer, with a render method that we will use
                        periodically to render the entire view. We attach some keys (Ctrl+C, Esc), which we could press
                        to terminate the app if we wanted.</p>

                    <p>Next, we need to implement the different sections of the view. Each section will be a neo-blessed
                        box, like mentioned earlier. We will implement a basic class for this, which will be extended by
                        other classes later:</p>


                    <pre>class TerminalBox {
constructor(config) {
    this.box = NeoBlessed.box(config);
}
}</pre>

                    <p>The most important thing to note here is that this class contains child items, which are also
                        neo-blessed boxes. That&rsquo;s why there are both config and childConfig props passed in the
                        constructor.</p>

                    <p>Also, the class has a scroll method with which you can navigate the items with the help of and
                        illusion made by different coloring of blurred and focused items. To help keep track of the
                        index of the focused child item, we are using a helper class called FocusIndexer (defined on
                        line 1 and instantiated on line 27).</p>

                    <p>Lastly, there is a createBoxChildAndAppend method for adding new children. This is not, all but
                        in the interest of time, I will stop here.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <div class="heading">
                    <h1>Streaming</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The songs from the queue should be sent to every consumer that is listening at the moment. This
                        is the next thing we need to implement. As I already mentioned, the Queue class will be in
                        charge of showing the queued up songs in the GUI. On top of that, this class will contain the
                        logic for emitting the songs to the clients.</p>

                    <p>Since we want to gradually broadcast audio data to the clients, it is somewhat obvious that this
                        will need to be implemented via streams or, in our case, the Node.js Stream API.</p>

                    <p>Now the first thing to note here is that the Stream API is primarily invented for a one-to-one
                        (unicast) transfer of chunked data in a pull-based manner, meaning the consumer determines the
                        speed of the transfer based on the speed at which it can process the data.</p>

                    <p>This is much better. As soon as a handler is attached to the data event, the readable will go to
                        the flowing mode and start streaming the data. We now have an elegant way to achieve one-to-many
                        transfer, i.e., to send the same chunk of data to every registered writable. On top of that, if
                        no writable is present, the readable will continue to stream the data, which is what we need
                        since songs on pretty much every radio must continue playing, even if no one is listening.
                        &#55357;&#56898;</p>

                    <p>We still haven&rsquo;t solved all the problems, though. If we only attach the handler, like in
                        the last code snippet, the readable (i.e., the song) would be consumed pretty much in a couple
                        of seconds. We don&rsquo;t want that; we want to stream the data slowly.</p>

                    <p>This can be done by using some kind of a throttling mechanism to slow down the streaming of the
                        chunks. In Node.js land, we can implement that with a transform stream (which is both a readable
                        and a writable, as we mentioned already) and a timer function. The goal of this transform stream
                        is to receive chunks from a readable and output the chunks to a writable at a determined rate,
                        which will be handled by a timer function inside the transform stream itself.</p>

                    <p>Since there are several published packages that already solve this problem, we&rsquo;re going to
                        use one called [throttle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/throttle) from npm. It is a class you
                        can use to instantiate a new transform stream by passing one argument: a number, representing
                        bytes per second. This transform stream would then limit the streaming of the chunks to be no
                        faster than the bytes per second you provided.</p>
